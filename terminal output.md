Welcome to Lumentis! Let's build you some docs. Some things to keep in mind:
- I'll be saving config files (state, LLM messages) in a folder called .lumentis in the current directory.
- If you'd like to repeat any steps, Ctrl+C and just start over.

? Pick a model for meta inference.
 Smarter is preferred, you can use a cheaper model for the actual writing later. Claude 3 Opus
? Do you want to stream outputs to console? 
 Looks awesome but clutters things up: 👎
? What's your primary source? 
 Drag a text file (or youtube link, experimental) in here, or leave empty/whitespace to open an editor: 
d:\Repo\Lumentis\os-intro-full-course-beginners-mike-murphy-v2\os-intro-full-course-beginners-mike-murphy-v2.txt
? Please enter an Anthropic API key.
 (You can leave this blank if it's already in the ENV variable.): 
************************************************************************************************************
? Do you have a short description of your source?
 Who's talking, what type of content is it etc.
 (Leave empty to generate - costs $0.7577):  The PrimarySource appears to be a transcript of a series of video lectures about operating systems. The lectures cover a  
wide range of topics related to operating system concepts, including hardware resources, disk input/output, memory management, processes, and more. The target audience for these lectures is likely students or professionals in computer science or a related field who want to learn about operating system fundamentals and implementation details.
? Do you have a short title or name?
 (Leave empty to generate - costs $0.7362):  Introduction to Operating System | Full Course for Beginners - Mike Murphy - V2
? Choose your own favicon! 
Please provide a URL only. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HebeHH/lumentis/choose-favicon/assets/default-favicon.png
? Do you have any core themes or keywords about the source or the intended audience?
 (Leave empty to generate - costs $0.7350):  Operating Systems, Memory Management, Process Management, CPU Scheduling, Kernel Architectures, Disk Input/Output, Unified Modeling Language (UML), Software Development Models, Object-Oriented Design, Virtual Memory
? Do you have any intended audience in mind?
 (Leave empty to generate - costs $0.7364):  computer science students, operating system course, software developers, system administrators, IT professionals
? Are you okay answering some questions about things that might not be well explained in the primary source?
 (Costs 0.8599):  👎
? Do you have an example of writing style you want to add in (adds cost but improves output, 
leave blank to skip. Drag in a file):

? Are there any sections you'd like to add or things to change? (Blank to accept, regneration costs ~1.0628):
? Do you want to add diagrams, latex and flowcharts? (This works perfectly 98% of the time):  👍

Calculating final writing costs...

? We can finally start writing our 88 pages! Pick a model to generate content:  Claude 3 Opus
? Seems we haven't set up the scaffold yet. Which runner do you prefer? Bun would be fastest if you have it. npm

Ready to start?  👍


And we're off! If this helps do find https://github.com/hrishioa/lumentis and drop a star!




AND WE'RE DONE! Run `npm run dev` to start the docs server once you quit. You can always rerun Lumentis to make changes.

    You can learn more about Nextra (what we use for our theme) here: https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/start.
