# Use Cases

Use cases are an essential tool in capturing and documenting system requirements. They provide a structured approach to describing the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and the system under development. Use cases help in understanding the system's behavior from the perspective of its users and stakeholders.

## What are Use Cases?

A use case is a textual description of how an actor interacts with the system to achieve a specific goal. It outlines the steps involved in the interaction, including the main flow of events, alternative flows, and exceptional flows. Use cases focus on the **what** rather than the **how**, emphasizing the desired functionality rather than the technical implementation details.

Use cases are not meant to replace other forms of requirements documentation, such as user stories or functional specifications. Instead, they complement these artifacts by providing a higher-level view of the system's behavior.

## Benefits of Use Cases

Use cases offer several benefits in the software development process:

- They help in understanding and communicating the system's requirements from the users' perspective.
- They provide a basis for system design and implementation by identifying the necessary interactions and flows.
- They serve as a foundation for system testing, allowing test cases to be derived from the use case scenarios.
- They facilitate discussions and collaboration among stakeholders, developers, and testers.

## Elements of a Use Case

A typical use case consists of the following elements:

- **Title**: A brief and descriptive name for the use case.
- **Actor**: The user or external system that interacts with the system to achieve a goal.
- **Preconditions**: The conditions that must be satisfied before the use case can be executed.
- **Main Flow**: The primary sequence of steps that describe the interaction between the actor and the system.
- **Alternative Flows**: Variations or extensions to the main flow that handle different scenarios or exceptional cases.
- **Postconditions**: The state of the system after the use case has been successfully completed.

Here's an example of a simple use case template:

```markdown
# Use Case: [Title]

## Actor
[Description of the actor]

## Preconditions
- [Precondition 1]
- [Precondition 2]
- ...

## Main Flow
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. ...

## Alternative Flows
- [Alternative Flow 1]
  1. [Step 1]
  2. [Step 2]
  3. ...
- [Alternative Flow 2]
  1. [Step 1]
  2. [Step 2]
  3. ...

## Postconditions
- [Postcondition 1]
- [Postcondition 2]
- ...
```

## Best Practices for Writing Use Cases

When writing use cases, consider the following best practices:

- Use clear and concise language, avoiding technical jargon.
- Focus on the user's goals and the system's behavior, not on implementation details.
- Use active voice and present tense to describe the steps.
- Keep the use cases independent and avoid unnecessary dependencies between them.
- Ensure that the use cases are testable and can be validated against the system's requirements.

## Subsections

Use cases are typically accompanied by additional artifacts that provide visual representations and detailed specifications:

- [Use Case Diagrams](/uml-and-use-cases/use-cases/use-case-diagrams): Visual diagrams that show the relationships between actors and use cases.
- [Use Case Specifications](/uml-and-use-cases/use-cases/use-case-specifications): Detailed descriptions of each use case, including pre and postconditions, main and alternative flows, and exceptions.

By leveraging use cases effectively, software development teams can capture and communicate system requirements clearly, leading to better design, implementation, and testing of the system.
