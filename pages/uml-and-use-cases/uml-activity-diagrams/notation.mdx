# Notation

UML activity diagrams use a set of standardized notations to represent the flow of activities and actions within a system or process. Understanding these notations is crucial for creating and interpreting activity diagrams effectively.

## Basic Elements

The basic elements of a UML activity diagram include:

- **Initial Node**: Represented by a filled black circle, the initial node indicates the starting point of the activity flow.

- **Final Node**: Represented by a filled black circle within another circle, the final node signifies the end of the activity flow.

- **Action**: Depicted as a rounded rectangle, an action represents a single step or task within the activity flow.

- **Control Flow**: Shown as a solid arrow, the control flow indicates the sequence and direction of actions within the diagram.

Activity diagrams focus on the flow of control from one action to another, emphasizing the sequence and conditions for coordination of actions.

## Advanced Elements

In addition to the basic elements, UML activity diagrams include advanced notations for representing more complex behaviors:

- **Decision Node**: Represented by a diamond shape, a decision node indicates a point where the flow branches based on a condition.

- **Merge Node**: Also depicted as a diamond shape, a merge node brings multiple flows back together into a single flow.

- **Fork Node**: Shown as a thick vertical or horizontal bar, a fork node splits the flow into multiple concurrent or parallel flows.

- **Join Node**: Also represented by a thick vertical or horizontal bar, a join node synchronizes multiple concurrent or parallel flows back into a single flow.

<Steps>
### Step 1

Identify the main activities and actions within the system or process you want to model.

### Step 2

Determine the sequence and flow of these activities, including any decisions, forks, or joins.

### Step 3

Use the appropriate notations to represent each element in the activity diagram, ensuring clarity and readability.
</Steps>

By combining these notations, you can create comprehensive activity diagrams that effectively communicate the dynamic behavior of a system or process.
