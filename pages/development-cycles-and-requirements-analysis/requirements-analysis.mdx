# Requirements Analysis

Requirements analysis is a crucial step in the software development process, where the development team works closely with stakeholders to gather, analyze, and document the requirements for the system under development. The primary goal of requirements analysis is to ensure that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its users.

During this phase, the team identifies the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Functional requirements describe what the system should do, while non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform and behave.

Requirements analysis helps to minimize the risk of developing a system that fails to meet user expectations or business objectives.

The requirements analysis process typically involves the following activities:

1. **Gathering requirements:** This involves conducting interviews, workshops, and surveys with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.

2. **Analyzing requirements:** The gathered requirements are analyzed to ensure they are clear, consistent, and feasible. Conflicts and dependencies between requirements are also identified and resolved.

3. **Documenting requirements:** The analyzed requirements are documented in a clear and concise manner, often using techniques such as user stories, use cases, and requirements specifications.

4. **Validating requirements:** The documented requirements are reviewed and validated by stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs and expectations.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Identify stakeholders

Identify all individuals and groups who have an interest in the system, including end-users, business owners, and technical teams.

### Step 2: Gather requirements

Use techniques such as interviews, workshops, and surveys to gather requirements from stakeholders.

### Step 3: Analyze requirements

Analyze the gathered requirements to ensure they are clear, consistent, and feasible. Identify and resolve any conflicts or dependencies.

### Step 4: Document requirements

Document the analyzed requirements using techniques such as user stories, use cases, and requirements specifications.

### Step 5: Validate requirements

Review and validate the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs and expectations.
</Steps>

Requirements analysis is an iterative process, and the development team may need to revisit and refine the requirements throughout the development lifecycle as new information becomes available or priorities change.

The output of the requirements analysis phase is a comprehensive set of requirements that serve as a foundation for the subsequent phases of the software development process, including [design](/development-cycles-and-requirements-analysis/requirements-analysis/functional-requirements), [implementation](/development-cycles-and-requirements-analysis/requirements-analysis/non-functional-requirements), and testing.
