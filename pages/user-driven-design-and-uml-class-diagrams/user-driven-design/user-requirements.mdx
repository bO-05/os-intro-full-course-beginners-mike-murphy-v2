# User Requirements

User requirements play a crucial role in guiding software design and development. They represent the needs, wants, and expectations of the end-users and stakeholders of a software system. Gathering and analyzing user requirements is an essential step in the user-driven design process, as it helps ensure that the final product meets the users' needs and delivers value.

## Types of User Requirements

User requirements can be classified into two main categories:

1. **Functional Requirements**: These requirements describe the specific functionalities and features that the software system should provide. They define what the system should do and how it should behave in different scenarios. Examples of functional requirements include:
   - The system should allow users to create an account and log in.
   - The system should enable users to search for products based on keywords.
   - The system should generate monthly sales reports.

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**: These requirements specify the qualities and constraints that the software system should possess. They define how well the system should perform and the standards it should meet. Examples of non-functional requirements include:
   - The system should have a response time of less than 2 seconds.
   - The system should be accessible through web browsers on desktop and mobile devices.
   - The system should comply with data privacy regulations.

It's important to note that both functional and non-functional requirements are equally important and should be considered during the software design process.

## Gathering User Requirements

Gathering user requirements involves various techniques and methods to elicit information from users and stakeholders. Some common techniques include:

<Steps>

### Interviews
Conducting one-on-one interviews with users and stakeholders to understand their needs, pain points, and expectations.

### Surveys and Questionnaires
Collecting information from a larger group of users through surveys and questionnaires to gather insights and preferences.

### Focus Groups
Facilitating group discussions with users to explore their opinions, experiences, and desired features.

### Observation
Observing users in their natural work environment to understand their workflows, challenges, and interaction patterns.

### Document Analysis
Reviewing existing documentation, such as business processes, user manuals, and competitor analysis, to identify requirements.

</Steps>

## Documenting User Requirements

Once the user requirements are gathered, they need to be properly documented to serve as a reference throughout the software development lifecycle. User requirements can be documented using various formats, such as:

- **User Stories**: Short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality from the user's perspective. They typically follow the format: "As a [user role], I want [goal/desire] so that [benefit/value]."
- **Use Cases**: Detailed descriptions of how users interact with the system to achieve specific goals. Use cases include actors (users), preconditions, steps, and postconditions. Learn more about use cases in the [Use Cases](/uml-and-use-cases/use-cases) section.
- **Requirements Specification Document**: A comprehensive document that outlines all the functional and non-functional requirements of the software system. It serves as a contract between the development team and stakeholders.

## Validating User Requirements

Validating user requirements is an essential step to ensure that the gathered requirements accurately reflect the users' needs and expectations. Validation techniques include:

- **Prototype Testing**: Creating interactive prototypes or mockups of the software system and gathering user feedback to validate the requirements. Learn more about prototyping in the [Prototyping](/user-driven-design-and-uml-class-diagrams/user-driven-design/prototyping) subsection.
- **Requirements Review**: Conducting formal reviews with users and stakeholders to go through the documented requirements and ensure their accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Defining specific criteria that the software system must meet to be considered acceptable by the users. These criteria serve as a basis for testing and validation.

By gathering, documenting, and validating user requirements, software teams can ensure that they have a clear understanding of what needs to be built and can align their efforts with the users' expectations. This user-centric approach helps in creating software systems that are usable, valuable, and meet the needs of the intended audience.
