# Interrupts and Interrupt Handling

Interrupts and interrupt handling are crucial components of modern operating systems. They allow the CPU to efficiently handle events and manage resources without constantly polling for changes. In this section, we'll explore the concepts of interrupts and interrupt handling in depth.

## What are Interrupts?

Interrupts are signals sent to the CPU by hardware or software, indicating that an event requires immediate attention. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU suspends its current execution, saves its state, and transfers control to a special routine called an *interrupt handler* or *interrupt service routine (ISR)*.

Interrupts can be classified into two main categories:

- **Hardware Interrupts**: Generated by hardware devices, such as timers, keyboards, or network interfaces, to signal events like data availability or error conditions.
- **Software Interrupts**: Generated by software, such as system calls or exceptions, to request services from the operating system or indicate exceptional conditions.

## Interrupt Handling

Interrupt handling is the process of responding to interrupts and executing the appropriate interrupt service routines. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU performs the following steps:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Save the current state
The CPU saves its current state, including the program counter and register values, onto the stack.

### Step 2: Determine the interrupt type
The CPU determines the type of interrupt based on the interrupt vector or interrupt number.

### Step 3: Invoke the interrupt handler
The CPU transfers control to the corresponding interrupt handler or ISR.

### Step 4: Execute the interrupt handler
The interrupt handler performs the necessary actions to service the interrupt, such as reading data from a device or updating system variables.

### Step 5: Restore the previous state
After the interrupt handler completes its execution, the CPU restores the saved state from the stack and resumes the interrupted program.
