# Interrupts

Interrupts are a crucial component of operating systems that enable efficient and responsive handling of events. They provide a mechanism for the CPU to temporarily suspend the execution of the current program and transfer control to a special routine called an **interrupt handler** or **interrupt service routine (ISR)**. 

Interrupts can be triggered by both hardware and software events. Hardware interrupts are generated by external devices, such as timers, keyboards, or network interfaces, to signal the occurrence of specific events or request attention from the CPU. On the other hand, software interrupts, also known as exceptions or traps, are triggered by software instructions or exceptional conditions, such as division by zero or invalid memory access.

Interrupts play a vital role in enabling the operating system to manage and coordinate various system resources, handle I/O operations, and respond to external events in a timely manner.

The interrupt mechanism follows a general sequence of steps:

<Steps>
### Step 1: Interrupt Request

When an interrupt occurs, the device or software raises an interrupt request signal to notify the CPU.

### Step 2: Interrupt Acknowledgment

The CPU acknowledges the interrupt request and saves the current state of the executing program, including the program counter and register values, onto the stack.

### Step 3: Interrupt Handling

The CPU determines the type of interrupt and transfers control to the corresponding interrupt handler or ISR. The interrupt handler is responsible for processing the interrupt and performing the necessary actions.

### Step 4: Interrupt Return

Once the interrupt handler completes its task, it restores the saved state of the interrupted program from the stack and returns control back to the program, resuming its execution from where it left off.
</Steps>

The interrupt mechanism is implemented using an **interrupt vector table**, which is a data structure that maps interrupt numbers to their corresponding interrupt handlers. When an interrupt occurs, the CPU uses the interrupt number as an index into the interrupt vector table to locate the address of the appropriate interrupt handler.

Interrupts can be classified into two main categories:

1. [Hardware Interrupts](/interrupts-and-interrupt-handling/interrupts/hardware-interrupts)
2. [Software Interrupts](/interrupts-and-interrupt-handling/interrupts/software-interrupts)

Managing interrupts efficiently is crucial for the overall performance and responsiveness of an operating system. Interrupt handling should be kept as short and fast as possible to minimize the impact on the executing programs and ensure timely response to events.

In summary, interrupts provide a powerful mechanism for operating systems to handle external events, manage system resources, and enable efficient multitasking. By allowing the CPU to be interrupted and transfer control to specific routines, interrupts enable the operating system to respond quickly to various events and maintain a responsive environment for running programs.
