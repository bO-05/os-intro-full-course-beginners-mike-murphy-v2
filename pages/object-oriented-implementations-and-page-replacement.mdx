# Object-Oriented Implementations and Page Replacement

Object-oriented programming (OOP) has become a widely adopted paradigm in software development, offering benefits such as modularity, reusability, and maintainability. In this section, we will explore the key concepts of object-oriented implementations and their relevance to operating systems. Additionally, we will delve into the topic of page replacement, a crucial aspect of memory management in operating systems.

## Object-Oriented Implementations

Object-oriented programming revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, encapsulating data and methods into a single unit. By leveraging the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, object-oriented implementations provide a powerful framework for designing and building complex systems.

## Page Replacement

In operating systems, memory management is a critical task that involves efficiently allocating and deallocating memory resources. When the available physical memory is limited, the operating system employs various techniques to optimize memory usage. One such technique is page replacement, which comes into play when there is not enough free memory to accommodate new pages.

Page replacement algorithms determine which pages should be removed from memory to make room for new pages when the physical memory is full. These algorithms aim to minimize the number of page faults and optimize the overall system performance.

Some common page replacement algorithms include:

- First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Optimal Page Replacement (OPR)
- Clock Algorithm
