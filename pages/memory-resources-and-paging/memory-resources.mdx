# Memory Resources

In this section, we will explore the memory resources managed by operating systems. Memory is a crucial component of any computing system, as it provides temporary storage for programs and data currently in use. Operating systems are responsible for efficiently managing memory resources to ensure optimal performance and fair allocation among processes.

## Physical Memory

Physical memory, also known as RAM (Random Access Memory), is the hardware component that stores data and instructions temporarily for quick access by the CPU. It is a limited resource that must be carefully managed by the operating system.

<Callout type="info">
  Physical memory is volatile, meaning its contents are lost when the system is powered off.
</Callout>

## Virtual Memory

Virtual memory is a technique used by operating systems to extend the available memory beyond the limits of physical RAM. It allows processes to access more memory than is physically present in the system, enabling the execution of larger programs and the management of multiple processes simultaneously.

<Callout type="warning">
  Excessive use of virtual memory can lead to performance degradation due to increased disk I/O.
</Callout>

By leveraging both physical and virtual memory, operating systems can provide a seamless experience to users while optimizing the utilization of available memory resources. In the following subsections, we will delve deeper into the concepts of [physical memory](/memory-resources-and-paging/memory-resources/physical-memory) and [virtual memory](/memory-resources-and-paging/memory-resources/virtual-memory) and explore how operating systems manage these resources effectively.
