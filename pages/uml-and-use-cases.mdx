# UML and Use Cases

Unified Modeling Language (UML) and use cases are essential tools in software engineering for capturing system requirements, modeling system behavior, and communicating design ideas among team members. UML provides a standardized set of diagrams that help visualize and document various aspects of a software system, while use cases describe how users interact with the system to achieve specific goals.

In this section, we will explore two key components of UML and use cases:

- [UML Activity Diagrams](/uml-and-use-cases/uml-activity-diagrams): Activity diagrams are used to model the flow of control and the sequence of activities in a system or process. They are particularly useful for describing complex business processes, algorithms, and workflows.

- [Use Cases](/uml-and-use-cases/use-cases): Use cases capture the functional requirements of a system by describing how users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals. They help in understanding the system's behavior from the users' perspective and serve as a basis for system design and testing.

By employing UML and use cases, software engineers can:

- Improve communication among stakeholders, developers, and users
- Identify and clarify system requirements
- Validate system design against user expectations
- Guide the development process and prioritize features
- Facilitate system testing and maintenance

UML and use cases are not limited to software engineering. They can be applied to various domains, such as business process modeling, systems engineering, and product design.

In the following subsections, we will delve deeper into UML activity diagrams and use cases, exploring their notation, examples, and best practices for effectively applying them in software engineering projects.
